# GONFC

/!\ This library is a work in progress /!\ 

Original goal is to rewrite the excellent [libnfc](https://github.com/nfc-tools/libnfc) library in golang for easier evolution (for me at least). My first need was to evolve ACR122U driver (led/buzzer support) and add more drivers using other excellent project [pigpio](https://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/).
